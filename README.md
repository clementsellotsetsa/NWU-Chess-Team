3. **Enable Member Matches and Practice Games**: Facilitate matches between team players, allowing them to challenge each other in an online format to improve their skills.
4. **Recruit New Members**: Offer an easy way for interested students to join the team and be integrated into the team’s activities and resources.
5. **Support Tournament Selection**: Allow the coach to track players’ progress and identify top performers who can represent the team in inter-university tournaments.
